<p>Hello, I'm Game Maker, I'm the Main Character for my company name, Microgames.</p>
<p>Evening I have to change my name to Gamemaker1000, does not to say my real name.</p>
<p>Because, I like to keep my serect identity off the social media.</p>
<p>Plus, I wanted to move forfard, Because, everyone has mental issues just like I have.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks I have anger issues, Because, I biggest problems any one is bigger then me, tells me what's to do a lot.</p>
<p>I don't even appreciate any thing I do and don't repect to my behavior and my hunger.</p>
<p>The reason why, I wanted to live my own in the city of charlotte, Because, it's lot more fun to go out different places.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn, how to make video games.</p>
<p>I like the japen cartoon shows, and, playing video games too.</p>
<p>Couple years ago, I planning to come a video game developer, so I can make more money</p>
<p>The reason I feel like I wanted in the city of my own, I best away to get away from this chaotic neighbourhood life.</p>
<p>I have been starting my stage 2 assignments, I took my time with the instructions.</p>
<p>There one japen cartoon show of seasons what's not happy it, yu-gi-oh 5ds season 2.</p>
<p>The reason why I don't like this season 2, in yu-gi-oh 5ds, 5 or 6 peoples turn in to Dark Signers.</p>
<p>I like the capcom characters mostly, Because, it's better than Marvel characters.</p>
<p>Plus I wanted to go to cpcc in the morning to eat lunch around 12:00pm<p>
<p>Last night, I didn't have enougth strength to move, Because I feel like something bad will happened.</p>
<p>I have been having fun with ai some much.</p>
